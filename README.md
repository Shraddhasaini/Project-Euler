## What is Project Euler?
>**Project Euler** is a series of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills. Somebody who enjoys learning new area of mathematics, project Euler is going to be a fun journey.

## Where are the problems ?
>The problems are right here in their official [archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## About Project Euler 	:bookmark_tabs:

### Where should I start?
>That depends on your background. There are two tables containing problems. The [Recent](https://projecteuler.net/recent) problems table lists the ten most recently published problems, so if you are new to Project Euler then you may prefer to start with the [Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives) to get a feel for the different types/difficulties of our problems. The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems which follow. In the archives table you will be able to see how many people have solved each problem; as a general rule of thumb the more people that have solved it, the easier it is. To assist further there is a difficulty rating system which may also help you decide where to start. You are able to sort the problems in the archives table on ID, Solved By, or Difficulty.

### I've written my program but should it take days to get to the answer?
>Absolutely not! Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.
