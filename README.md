# Project Euler  

## What is Project Euler?
>**Project Euler** is a se
ries of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills. Somebody who enjoys learning new area of mathematics, project Euler is going to be a fun journey.

## Where are the problems ?
>The problems are right here in their official [archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## [About Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)

> ### Where should I start?
>>That depends on your background. There are two tables containing problems. The [Recent](https://projecteuler.net/recent) problems table lists the ten most recently published problems, so if you are new to Project Euler then you may prefer to start with the [Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives) to get a feel for the different types/difficulties of our problems. The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems which follow. In the archives table you will be able to see how many people have solved each problem; as a general rule of thumb the more people that have solved it, the easier it is. To assist further there is a difficulty rating system which may also help you decide where to start. You are able to sort the problems in the archives table on ID, Solved By, or Difficulty.

> ### I've written my program but should it take days to get to the answer?
>>Absolutely not! Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.
>
> ### Does it matter if it takes more than one minute to solve?
>> Of course not, but that should provide the impetus to return to the problem and see how you can improve your approach. But remember that once you've solved a particular problem you will be able to access a thread relating to that problem and it is here that you may be able to pick some tips from others that have solved it.
>
> ### I solved it by using a search engine, does that matter?
>> Making use of the internet to research a problem is to be encouraged as there could be hidden treasures of mathematics to be discovered beneath the surface of many of these problems. However, there is a fine line between researching ideas and using the answer you found on another website. If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?
>
> ### I've checked my program ten times now and I keep getting told my answer is wrong! Have you made a mistake?
>> With newly released problems it is quite possible that a small error may have slipped through the net, or maybe the wording is slightly ambiguous and the problem has not been explained as well as it could. However, when so many people have hit the target and one marksman misses ten times on the run, he/she can hardly shoot his/her own foot and conclude that because the gun is working properly the fault must lie in the target.
>
> ### Do you have any hints on solving problems?
>> Read the details of the problem very carefully and make note of any example cases given. Experiment with pencil and paper to get a feel for the ideas behind the problem. If the ideas are new to you, use the internet or books to get some background; the problem should contain clues as to what to look-up. Try writing a program to generate for simple cases and check that your output agrees with the example cases; this will confirm you've understood the problem and are heading in the right direction. Based on this try to extrapolate to estimate the time it will take to get the final answer and if it's going to take significantly more than a minute rethink your strategy.
>
> ### What are the levels and awards all about?
>> For every twenty-five problems you solve you will advance one level, which should help encourage you to make short term targets. The awards are earned for a variety of reasons and if you are wondering what you need to do to earn an award go to the Statistics page and you can see a complete list of current awards. In the case of both levels and awards you can click on the image on the Statistics page to see which members are currently at that level or who has earned a particular award. It is hoped that the levels and awards will provide a bit of extra fun as you solve the problems.
>
> ### There seems to be discussion threads for each problem, so why can't I access some of them?
>> You are only able to access a thread for a particular problem once you have solved it. Once you have access you will be able to see how other members have solved the problem, discuss methods, and share your insights.
>
> ### What is Kudos?
>> The purpose of Kudos is to let the poster or other members know that you found a particular post extremely helpful, useful, or well written. You can award up to 5 Kudos points to each problem thread, so only use when you think a post really deserves it.
>
> ### Why do some posts disappear?
>> Only the first one hundred posts are automatically made permanent. After this only the most recent one hundred posts are kept; older posts will be automatically deleted. However, if a particularly good post is made then one of the administrators may make a post permanent. Kudos is a useful way to alert administrators to a post which members have found helpful and should be made permanent.
>
> ### Is there anywhere else we can discuss and meet other members?
>> Indeed there is! There is an alternative phpBB official forum which has been set up to allow members to engage in general discussions, share ideas relating to problem solving and programming, make suggestions about the website, and ask for clarification on the wording of a particular problem.
