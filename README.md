## What is Project Euler?
>**Project Euler** is a series of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills. Somebody who enjoys learning new area of mathematics, project Euler is going to be a fun journey.

## Where are the problems ?
>The problems are right here in their official [archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

> ### Where should I start?
>>That depends on your background. There are two tables containing problems. The [Recent](https://projecteuler.net/recent) problems table lists the ten most recently published problems, so if you are new to Project Euler then you may prefer to start with the [Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives) to get a feel for the different types/difficulties of our problems. The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems which follow. In the archives table you will be able to see how many people have solved each problem; as a general rule of thumb the more people that have solved it, the easier it is. To assist further there is a difficulty rating system which may also help you decide where to start. You are able to sort the problems in the archives table on ID, Solved By, or Difficulty.

> ### I've written my program but should it take days to get to the answer?
>>Absolutely not! Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.

> ### Does it matter if it takes more than one minute to solve?
>> Of course not, but that should provide the impetus to return to the problem and see how you can improve your approach. But remember that once you've solved a particular problem you will be able to access a thread relating to that problem and it is here that you may be able to pick some tips from others that have solved it.

I solved it by using a search engine, does that matter?
Making use of the internet to research a problem is to be encouraged as there could be hidden treasures of mathematics to be discovered beneath the surface of many of these problems. However, there is a fine line between researching ideas and using the answer you found on another website. If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?

I've checked my program ten times now and I keep getting told my answer is wrong! Have you made a mistake?
With newly released problems it is quite possible that a small error may have slipped through the net, or maybe the wording is slightly ambiguous and the problem has not been explained as well as it could. However, when so many people have hit the target and one marksman misses ten times on the run, he/she can hardly shoot his/her own foot and conclude that because the gun is working properly the fault must lie in the target.
